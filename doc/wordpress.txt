<h3>Overview</h3>

Occasionally it's useful to have the thumbnail for a YouTube video, and I often forget the exact path for doing this.  So I wrote this script that fetches the uri for the user.

<h3>Challenges</h3>
<dl>
<dt><em>Challenge</em>: The uri had to be parsed.</dt>

<dd><em>Solution</em>: Since this is entirely Javascript based and in the browser there are no safety issues associated with the parsing.  Upon failure the page simply tells the user there was a problem. (Resolved)</dd>
